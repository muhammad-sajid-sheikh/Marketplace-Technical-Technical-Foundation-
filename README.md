SANITY CMS AS BACKEND

I am using Sanity CMS as the backend for my project to efficiently manage and deliver content. Here's why I chose it:

It allows me to separate the backend from the frontend, providing flexibility to use frameworks like Next.js or React.

2. Customizable Schemas:
I can define and manage custom content structures tailored to my project's requirements using JavaScript.

3. Real-Time Updates:
Content changes are reflected instantly, enabling seamless collaboration and fast iteration.

4. API Integration:
Sanity’s powerful GraphQL and REST APIs make data delivery smooth and efficient for my frontend.

5. Media Handling:
Built-in tools for managing images and files simplify multimedia content management.

6. Scalable Solution:
Sanity scales with my project, ensuring reliable performance even as the application grows.

By using Sanity CMS, I’ve streamlined my content management workflow, making the development process faster and more efficient.

THIRD PARTY APIs

I am using TCS API via ClickPost to enable efficient shipment tracking for my project. Here’s why it’s a great choice:

1. Real-Time Shipment Tracking:
The API provides live updates on the status of TCS shipments, ensuring users always have accurate information about their packages.

2. Estimated Delivery Dates:
It displays expected delivery dates, helping customers plan better and reducing inquiries about shipment timelines.

3. Non-Delivery Report Updates:
The API highlights reasons for non-delivery (e.g., address issues, recipient unavailable), enabling proactive resolution of delivery problems.

4. Seamless Integration:
ClickPost simplifies the integration process, offering a user-friendly way to connect with the TCS API in my application.

5. Scalability:
It is designed to handle multiple shipments efficiently, making it ideal for small businesses and large-scale e-commerce operations.

By leveraging the TCS API via ClickPost, I can enhance the shipment tracking experience for my customers, providing them with real-time updates and better transparency throughout the delivery process.

DESIGN SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

1. A user visits the marketplace frontend to browse products.
2. When a user navigates to the product page, A single product will be displayed, showing its title, price, description, images and more. 
3. user will have the option to add the product to their cart or wishlist.
4. The frontend makes a request to the Product Data API (powered by Sanity CMS)
to fetch product listings and details, which are displayed dynamically on the site.
5. When the user places an order, the order details are sent to Sanity CMS via an
API request, where the order is recorded.
6. Shipment tracking information is fetched through a Third-Party API and
displayed to the user in real-time.
7. Payment details are securely processed through the Payment Gateway, and a
confirmation is sent back to the user and recorded in Sanity CMS.
